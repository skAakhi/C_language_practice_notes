1. Static or Global Structures

Segment: Data Segment
If a structure is declared as static or is a global variable, its memory is allocated in the data segment.
The data segment contains:
Initialized data: For structures with explicitly initialized values.
Uninitialized data (BSS): For structures that are not explicitly initialized.

Example:
c
Copy code
struct MyStruct {
    int a;
    char b;
};

struct MyStruct globalStruct;  // Allocated in the BSS segment (uninitialized).
static struct MyStruct staticStruct = {10, 'A'};  // Allocated in the initialized data segment.



2. Local Structures
Segment: Stack
If a structure is declared inside a function (as a local variable), its memory is allocated on the stack.
Memory is automatically allocated when the function is called and deallocated when the function exits.

Example:
c
Copy code
void myFunction() {
    struct MyStruct localStruct;  // Allocated on the stack.
}



3. Dynamically Allocated Structures

Segment: Heap
If a structure is allocated using dynamic memory allocation (malloc, calloc, realloc), its memory resides in the heap.
You must manually manage the memory using free().

Example:
c
Copy code
struct MyStruct* ptr = (struct MyStruct*)malloc(sizeof(struct MyStruct));  // Allocated on the heap.
free(ptr);  // Free the allocated memory.


Summary of Memory Segments
Type of Allocation	        Segment	Scope
Static/Global Structures	Data Segment	Whole program lifecycle
Local Structures	Stack	Function scope
Dynamically Allocated	Heap	Manual management (via malloc)
